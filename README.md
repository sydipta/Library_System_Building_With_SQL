# üìö **Project Tasks**

---

## üîß **CRUD Operations**

**Task 1: Create a New Book Record**

```sql
('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')
```

**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
**Objective**: Delete the record with `issued_id = 'IS104'` from the `issued_status` table.

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
**Objective**: Select all books issued by the employee with `emp_id = 'E101'`.

**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
**Objective**: Use `GROUP BY` to find members who have issued more than one book.

---

## üìë **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**

**Task 6: Create Summary Tables**
**Objective**: Use CTAS to generate new tables based on query results ‚Äì each book and total `book_issued_cnt`.

---

## üìä **Data Analysis & Findings**

**Task 7: Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**

**Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**

**Task 9: List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**

**Task 10: List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and Branch Details**

**Task 11: Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**

**Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**

---

## üß† **Advanced SQL Operations**

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

**Task 14: Update Book Status on Return**
Write a query to update the status of books in the `books` table to `"yes"` when they are returned (based on entries in the `return_status` table).

**Task 15: Branch Performance Report**
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing:

* Number of books issued
* Number of books returned
* Total revenue generated from book rentals

**Task 16: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books**
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status `"damaged"` in the `books` table. Display:

* Member name
* Book title
* Number of times they've issued damaged books

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Stored Procedure**
**Task 14**  
AND  
**Task 17: Manage Book Status**
**Objective**: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.

**Description**:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book based on its issuance or return:

* If a book is issued, the status should change to `'no'`.
* If a book is returned, the status should change to `'yes'`.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project outlines a comprehensive set of tasks that reflect real-world scenarios in managing a library system using SQL. From basic CRUD operations and CTAS implementations to advanced analytics and stored procedures, each task builds critical skills in data manipulation, query optimization, and structured reporting. By completing these tasks, one can gain practical experience in handling relational databases, enhancing both technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities essential for data-driven application development.
